- _Code generation_ aka _vibe coding_: _"*Vibe coding*, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, describes an increasingly popular approach to writing software: express the code you want in a few sentences to an AI system like ChatGPT or Claude, then polish and (hopefully!) test the generated result"_[^VibeCodingPost]. Cassie Kozyrkov has written a brilliant substack article _What is Vibe Coding: why you wouldn't want to do it and why you would ..._[^WhatIsVibeCoding] in which she _"walk(s) you through an example and present(s) the case for vibe coding and the case against it, analyzed from the POVs of the novice and the expert"_. My favourite quote is: _"Vibe coding is like playing archeologist in someone else's mistakes"_[^VibeCodingLinkedIn]. The key point is: _"Using AI to generate code for you doesn't eliminate the workâ€”it just shifts it from writing to explaining and reviewing, which isn't always a win."_ Arvind and Sayash's argument that _"if it takes you less time to review the code than to write it, then code generation is a win"_ is a good point but it overlooks the potential harms: we'll return to this later.
