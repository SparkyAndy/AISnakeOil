## From Cassie Kozyrkov

- **Traditional Programming** - Automate _tasks_ where there's one right answer: use human-written instructions.

- **Traditional AI: Predictive Analytics** - Automate _tasks_ where there's one right answer: use patterns in data. Example - facial recognition.

- **Generative AI** - Automate _tasks_ where there are endless right answers and each right answer is right in it's own way. When the right answers are endless, you need to change the paradigm to prove Return on Investment (ROI).
